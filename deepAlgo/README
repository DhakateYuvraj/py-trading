Condition 1: Volatility Contraction + Breakout Fade (Sell Premium)

Setup:

5min Bollinger Bands (20,2): Price breaks above upper band OR below lower band.
1min Volume: Spike ≥ 2x 5-period average during breakout.
3min RSI(14): >70 (for upside breakout) or <30 (for downside).
5min Close: Rejects breakout (closes back inside Bollinger Band).
Action:

Sell ATM call/put credit spread (15-30 delta) with 10-15min expiration.
Edge: False breakouts with high volume often reverse; volatility crush post-breakout.
Condition 2: Volume-Driven Momentum (Buy Directional)

Setup:

3min Candle: Closes >1.5x ATR(14) from prior close (strong trend).
1min Volume: Sustained increase (3 consecutive bars ≥ 1.8x 20-period avg).
5min MACD: Bullish crossover (for calls) or bearish (for puts).
Action:

Buy ITM call/put (70-80 delta) with 30-60min expiration.
Edge: High volume + ATR expansion signals continuation; ITM options reduce gamma risk.
Condition 3: Mean Reversion via RSI Divergence (Sell Premium)

Setup:

5min RSI(14): >75 (bearish) or <25 (bullish).
1min Price Action: New high/low, but RSI(14) fails to confirm (divergence).
3min Volume: Declining during the divergence (weak follow-through).
Action:

Sell OTM iron condor (10-15 delta wings) expiring in 1-2hrs.
Edge: Overextended moves with divergence + low volume often revert.
Condition 4: Gamma Scalping on Support/Resistance

Setup:

5min Chart: Price bounces 3+ times off a level (e.g., $100) in the past 2hrs.
1min Close: Touches level again with volume <0.8x 20-period avg.
3min Stochastic(14,3): Overbought (>80) or oversold (<20).
Action:

Sell ATM straddle (delta-neutral) with 30-45min expiration.
Edge: Weak-volume retests of strong S/R rarely break through; theta decay accelerates.
Key Backtesting Parameters:

Filters: Only trade between 10:00 AM – 2:30 PM (avoid open/close noise).
Profit Target/Stop Loss: 25% profit or 100% loss (adjust via Kelly Criterion).
Validation: Test on 3+ months of data; look for Sharpe Ratio >1.5.

1. Warmup and Cooldown Rules
Warmup Period:
The algo waits for a few minutes (3 minutes as set by STARTING_WARMUP_PERIOD) after it starts before looking for any trade signals.
Cooldown Period:
It also checks that at least 5 minutes (min_holding_period) have passed since the last signal for the same token to avoid trading too frequently.
2. Breakout Strategy Conditions
This strategy checks 7 conditions (one of which is effectively repeated) before signaling a breakout trade:

RSI Data Available:
It first confirms that the three-minute data contains an RSI value.
RSI Within a Neutral Range:
The current RSI must be between 30 and 70 (i.e., not in an overbought or oversold zone).
Sufficient One-Minute Data:
There must be at least 15 one-minute candles available to assess recent price behavior.
Price Consolidation Check:
It calculates the price range (difference between the highest high and the lowest low over the last 15 one-minute candles) relative to the average close price. If this fluctuation is more than 0.5% (0.005 when expressed as a fraction), the market is not considered consolidated, and the condition fails.
Volume Surge Condition:
The volume of the latest one-minute candle must be at least 1.5 times the average volume over the consolidation period. This surge in volume is seen as a sign of an impending breakout.
Price Above VWAP:
The three-minute close price must be above the VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price). This suggests that buyers are in control.
RSI Check (Again):
The RSI is checked once more to ensure it’s still within the neutral range (between 30 and 70). This is essentially a safeguard.
3. Mean Reversion Strategy Conditions
This strategy relies on moving average crossovers and requires 2 key conditions (after ensuring enough data is available):

Enough Historical Data:
There must be at least 50 candles available to perform a meaningful moving average calculation.
EMA Crossover:
It looks at the 20-period and 50-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs):
Buy Signal: If the 20-EMA has just crossed from above to below the 50-EMA (i.e., in the previous candle 20-EMA was above 50-EMA but now it is below).
Sell Signal: If the 20-EMA has just crossed from below to above the 50-EMA.
4. Trade Exit Logic
If a position is already open, the algorithm also checks whether the new signal indicates a reversal relative to the current position. For example, if you are in a “LONG” position and a signal comes in suggesting a “SHORT” (or a “SELL” signal in the mean reversion strategy), it triggers an exit from the current trade.

In Summary
Breakout Strategy: Checks 7 conditions (RSI availability, RSI level, data length, consolidation range, volume surge, price above VWAP, and a repeated RSI check) before signaling a breakout trade.
Mean Reversion Strategy: Requires enough data (at least 50 candles) and then checks for a clear EMA crossover to signal a reversal trade (either BUY or SELL).
Additional Timing Checks: A warmup period at the start and a cooldown period between trades ensure signals aren’t generated too early or too frequently.
This layered approach helps the algorithm be cautious about entering trades only when several market conditions line up, reducing the chance of false signals.
